Credit Scoring Business Understanding
1. Influence of Basel II Accord on Model Interpretability
The Basel II Capital Accord emphasizes the importance of risk-sensitive capital requirements, requiring financial institutions to measure and manage credit risk rigorously. This pushes the need for interpretable and auditable models, as regulators and internal stakeholders must understand how risk is quantified. Transparent models enable banks to explain decisions to regulators, reduce compliance risks, and maintain trust in the model’s outputs. Hence, developing a well-documented, interpretable model is essential for both regulatory approval and operational reliability.

2. Necessity and Risk of Proxy Variables
In the absence of a direct “default” label (such as missed payments or bankruptcy records), a proxy variable must be constructed (e.g., 90+ days past due). This surrogate allows model training but introduces risks: the proxy may not perfectly capture the true default behavior, leading to biased predictions. Using a flawed proxy can misclassify creditworthy customers or underestimate risk in others, potentially resulting in financial losses or regulatory scrutiny.

3. Trade-Offs: Interpretable vs. Complex Models
Interpretable models like Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE) offer transparency, ease of validation, and alignment with regulatory expectations. However, they may underperform on complex, nonlinear relationships in data. On the other hand, models like Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) often yield higher predictive accuracy but are harder to interpret, audit, and defend under regulation. In a regulated financial context, the trade-off centers on balancing performance with accountability, transparency, and compliance. Often, a hybrid approach is used—leveraging GBMs for insight, but deploying interpretable models for decisioning.
